Pulls any tab active for 10 seconds or more to front of list.

I haven't paid my dev fee to google so it has to be installed manually:

&nbsp;  

* 1. Download [TabStack.crx](http://www.volv.org/TabStack.crx)
* 1. Open the extensions page from Settings -> More Tools -> Extensions (or go to chrome://extensions)
* 1. Drag extension file onto that page and install.   
&nbsp;  

Click icon to enable/disable. Can also use Alt-T. Once a tab has been active for 10 seconds it will be pulled to the front.  
I might add an option to change the delay amount later.
